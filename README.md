## About the project: 

Application was created for personal use with an idea of being able to filter out good questions from Stack Overflow on a daily basis.    
Generally, questions that have **3** or more  upvotes are good questions,  and you can learn from them.      
The most popular tag **javascript** has around 10-15 questions with 3 or more upvotes per day. Therefore, it's not too hard to  go through good questions every day.

This app was built with `react hooks` , `context api`, and `scss modules`. <br />

Without a Stackoverflow API key you can make 300 requests per day, with a key you can make 10,000 requests per day.<br />
